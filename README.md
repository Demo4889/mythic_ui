FiveM UI Made For Mythic RP

> NOTE: As with most MythicRP releases at this point, this has several calls to Mythic Framework resources that have not (and may not) be release publically. This is intended as a dev resource at most and not a simple drag & drop to use on public servers. Do not make any issues asking for it to be made to work on a public framework.
