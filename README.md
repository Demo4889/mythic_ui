FiveM UI Made For Mythic RP

![Mythic RP UI](https://i.imgur.com/WewLAnn.png)

This is a rather simple script that handles display & accessing various areas within an apartment

This makes use of NUI to not have to draw to the screen every frame which results in much better performance in a UI that handles everything of the UI aswell as seatbelt & vehicle ejections aswell as cruise control.

> NOTE: As with most MythicRP releases at this point, this has several calls to Mythic Framework resources that have not (and may not) be release publically. This is intended as a dev resource at most and not a simple drag & drop to use on public servers. Do not make any issues asking for it to be made to work on a public framework.
